# gitoxide WordPress Scenario

Git-backed WordPress content workflows, package installs, Playground snapshots, and server-side repo primitives.

## Current Native Slice

Native loose Git object storage with canonical object headers, SHA-1 object IDs, commit header parsing, and tree entry parsing/serialization.

## WordPress Deploy Tree Example

`examples/wordpress-content-tree.php` parses a fixture Git tree with `.wp-env.json`, `wp-config.php`, and `wp-content` entries. This models server-side PHP code inspecting a WordPress repository snapshot in shared hosting, Playground, package install, or migration tooling without shelling out to `git`.

## Next Task

Add loose direct/symbolic reference parsing and storage from `gix-ref`, then map packed-ref fixture parsing.
