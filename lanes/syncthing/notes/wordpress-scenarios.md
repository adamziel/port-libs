# syncthing WordPress Scenario

Resumable media/content synchronization for local-first WordPress and Playground folders.

## Current Native Slice

Native scanner-style content blocks now match Syncthing's `lib/scanner/blocks_test.go`
fixtures for empty files, SHA-256 block hashes, exact coverage checks, block-list
hashing, optional hash validation, and upstream per-file block size selection.

The example in `examples/wordpress-media-resume.php` shows how WordPress or
Playground import tooling can resume a partially synchronized upload by trusting
only blocks whose hashes still match the local bytes, then continuing at the
next byte offset.

## Next Task

Port `lib/protocol/vector.go` update/merge/compare semantics so WordPress
content sync can distinguish stale edits from concurrent local/remote edits.
