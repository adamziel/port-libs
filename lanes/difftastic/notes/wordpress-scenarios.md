# difftastic WordPress Scenario

Readable diffs for blocks, render callbacks, templates, theme.json, code snippets, and structured documents.

## Current Native Slice

Native token-level differ that avoids raw line-only comparison, classifies comments separately, carries delimiter open/close anchors, filters comments on request, normalizes trailing commas before closing delimiters, reports recursive changes inside bracketed syntax lists, applies upstream-style word/subword splitting for punctuation, Unicode words, and number boundaries, and renders escaped HTML for token, word/subword, and syntax-list changes.

The current WordPress fixture compares a block render callback where a PHP comment changes at the same time as the escaping API changes from `esc_html` to `wp_kses_post`. With `ignoreComments`, the diff hides the comment-only churn but still reports the security-relevant API change.

The recursive list fixture compares nested `register_block_type` arrays so block support changes such as `html => false` becoming `html => true` and new alignment support show up at the nested array path instead of as a single flattened line replacement.

The subword fixture compares a `register_block_style` slug change from `legacy-cta-v2` to `modern-cta-v3`. The number-aware word diff reports the changed slug words and version number separately, matching the upstream `src/words.rs` behavior used for readable inline changes.

The HTML fixture combines a block-style subword diff with a `theme.json` palette change. It emits escaped `<span>`, `<del>`, and `<ins>` markers with operation and syntax-list path metadata so a WordPress UI can embed reviewable diffs without trusting source text as HTML.

Run:

```sh
php lanes/difftastic/examples/wordpress-render-callback-diff.php
php lanes/difftastic/examples/wordpress-subword-diff.php
php lanes/difftastic/examples/wordpress-html-diff.php
```

## Next Task

Map another upstream `sample_files` display pair such as `html_*.html`, `json_*.json`, or `trailing_commas_*.js`, then tie it to HTML/JSON output expectations.
