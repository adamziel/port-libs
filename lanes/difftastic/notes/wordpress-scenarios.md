# difftastic WordPress Scenario

Readable diffs for blocks, render callbacks, templates, theme.json, code snippets, and structured documents.

## Current Native Slice

Native token-level differ that avoids raw line-only comparison, classifies comments separately, carries delimiter open/close anchors, filters comments on request, normalizes trailing commas before closing delimiters, reports recursive changes inside bracketed syntax lists, and applies upstream-style word/subword splitting for punctuation, Unicode words, and number boundaries.

The current WordPress fixture compares a block render callback where a PHP comment changes at the same time as the escaping API changes from `esc_html` to `wp_kses_post`. With `ignoreComments`, the diff hides the comment-only churn but still reports the security-relevant API change.

The recursive list fixture compares nested `register_block_type` arrays so block support changes such as `html => false` becoming `html => true` and new alignment support show up at the nested array path instead of as a single flattened line replacement.

The subword fixture compares a `register_block_style` slug change from `legacy-cta-v2` to `modern-cta-v3`. The number-aware word diff reports the changed slug words and version number separately, matching the upstream `src/words.rs` behavior used for readable inline changes.

Run:

```sh
php lanes/difftastic/examples/wordpress-render-callback-diff.php
php lanes/difftastic/examples/wordpress-subword-diff.php
```

## Next Task

Add HTML output for syntax-list and subword hunks around WordPress block/theme code, or map another upstream `sample_files` pair.
