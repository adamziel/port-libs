# Mozilla Readability Upstream Inventory

Upstream cache: `.upstream-cache/readability`

## Counted Denominator

- Package runner: `npm test` -> `mocha test/test-*.js`
- Static Mocha denominator: 1984 tests
- Fixture pages under `test/test-pages`: 130
- Fixture files: 390 (`source.html`, `expected.html`, `expected-metadata.json` for each page)
- `test-readability.js`: 1817 tests
- `test-isProbablyReaderable.js`: 139 tests
- `test-jsdomparser.js`: 28 tests

The `test-readability.js` count includes both jsdom and upstream `JSDOMParser` runs for every fixture. Per DOM parser pass, each fixture has six required assertions plus conditional `dir`, `lang`, and `publishedTime` checks. The metadata inventory contains 17 `dir`, 73 `lang`, and 33 `publishedTime` conditional checks.

## Runner Evidence

The previous sparse-cache probe reached the package script but failed before executing upstream tests because `node_modules` was absent:

```text
sh: line 1: mocha: command not found
```

That blocker is now resolved. The sparse checkout was expanded with the upstream implementation files and lockfile required by the test harness:

```text
git sparse-checkout add index.js Readability.js Readability-readerable.js JSDOMParser.js package-lock.json LICENSE.md
```

Dependencies were installed from the lockfile:

```text
npm ci --no-audit --fund=false
```

The canonical upstream runner now passes locally:

```text
npm test
1984 passing (30s)
```

## PHP Mapping

Current PHP tests map a narrow readerable/extraction slice:

- `isProbablyReaderable` default `minContentLength` and `minScore` thresholds.
- Custom `minContentLength` and `minScore` options.
- Visibility callback rejection.
- Hidden, `aria-hidden`, `li p`, and unlikely class/id candidate rejection.
- Unlikely candidate, role, and share-widget cleanup during extraction.
- Semantic article/main/section scoring preference.
- WordPress block serialization for extracted heading/paragraph content.
- Mozilla `test-pages/normalize-spaces` source/expected/metadata fixture copied into the lane and mapped for document-title precedence, readerable classification, null byline/site/published/dir metadata, whitespace-normalized excerpt, and extracted article text parity against `expected.html`.
- Mozilla `test-pages/parsely-metadata` copied into the lane and mapped for Parse.ly title, author, publication date, readerable classification, excerpt normalization, and text parity.
- Mozilla `test-pages/mozilla-2` copied into the lane and mapped for OpenGraph site name/description metadata, lang/dir extraction, false readerable classification, and preserved in-main header markers.
- Focused Mozilla lazy-image semantics for noscript fallback promotion, `data-old-src` placeholder preservation, and `data-srcset` promotion.

## Next Slice

Map another Mozilla fixture that exercises non-null byline, `siteName`, `publishedTime`, `lang`/`dir`, or media handling, then broaden metadata/media cleanup toward full fixture parity.
