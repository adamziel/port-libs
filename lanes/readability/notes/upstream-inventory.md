## Counted Denominator

- Package runner: `npm test` -> `mocha test/test-*.js`
- Static Mocha denominator: 1984 tests
- Fixture pages under `test/test-pages`: 130
- Fixture files: 390 (`source.html`, `expected.html`, `expected-metadata.json` for each page)
- `test-readability.js`: 1817 tests
- `test-isProbablyReaderable.js`: 139 tests
- `test-jsdomparser.js`: 28 tests

The `test-readability.js` count includes both jsdom and upstream `JSDOMParser` runs for every fixture. Per DOM parser pass, each fixture has six required assertions plus conditional `dir`, `lang`, and `publishedTime` checks. The metadata inventory contains 17 `dir`, 73 `lang`, and 33 `publishedTime` conditional checks.

## Runner Probe

`npm test` was attempted in the sparse upstream cache. It reached the package script but failed before executing upstream tests:

```text
sh: line 1: mocha: command not found
```

The exact blocker is missing upstream npm dependencies in `.upstream-cache/readability/node_modules`. Installing dependencies was deferred for this lane slice to keep network and CPU use modest.

## PHP Mapping

Current PHP tests map a narrow readerable/extraction slice:

- `isProbablyReaderable` default `minContentLength` and `minScore` thresholds.
- Custom `minContentLength` and `minScore` options.
- Visibility callback rejection.
- Hidden, `aria-hidden`, `li p`, and unlikely class/id candidate rejection.
- Unlikely candidate, role, and share-widget cleanup during extraction.
- Semantic article/main/section scoring preference.
- WordPress block serialization for extracted heading/paragraph content.
